# WaiterCustomer
Assignment 3 in OS course.
In this assignment we build a fast food restaurant with an interactive menu.
We can have several customers that can order and read the menu, while the waiters can only write while no one is reading or writing.
We used semaphores and accessed the shared memory according to the reader-writer algorithm.
